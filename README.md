The program is intended to take the users input, which is a series of numbers, and reverse them on the terminal. Also is to have data validation and the ability to play again. When the program is run it automatically inputs the numbers 5 and 4, thus prompting me to enter whether I would like to play again. If I enter yes or no it inputs the next lowest number, 3, and continues the cycle until reaching zero where if I entered no it ends the program. Where if I typed yes it restarts the program throwing 5 and 4 into the terminal again.
